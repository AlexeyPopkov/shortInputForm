# shortInputForm
Shortened and formatted InputForm for Wolfram Mathematica

Integrated into the Wolfram Language (version 12 or higher) as `ResourceFunction["ShortInputForm"]` and available in the Wolfram Function Repository at https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/ShortInputForm/.

Users of *Mathematica* 12 or higher can install `ShortInputForm` persistently so that it can be used like a built-in function: 
`ResourceFunction["PersistResourceFunction"]["ShortInputForm"]`.

This repository keeps the original author's version of the package which is compatible with Wolfram *Mathematica* starting at least from version 8. The original description is here: http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/55545/280.
